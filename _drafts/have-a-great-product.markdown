## How do I find new customers?

This is a question the keeps business owners (including myself) up late night. Because this question, if unanswered, can sink a business.

It's simple really, if you don't have customers to pay for your good or services, you don't have a business. You can have an amazing brand, perfectly aligned with your target market, with the right messaging and marketing assets, but if you don't find new customers every day... You die.

Which is what marketing is supposed to be for right? But the reality is that most marketing... doesn't work. Now before you get uptight and start telling me that it most certainly works, bear in mind I am Marketer, so obviously I believe that marketing works. The problem is that most marketing is incredibly ineffective. 

The fact is, there too many variables that go into each media channel, and so many external factors, that even the top experts in a given field can't guarantee success. Just ask an SEO Guru. There are assumptions, case studies, and methodologies that make success more likely, but you don't know how the market is going to receive your campaign until you run it, and you can't run it without money.

The most frustrating part is that you can't truly test any one channel without a decent chunk of cash. 

Personally, I've always cringed when I hear a media manager tell me that they need at least 3 months of "testing" budget to really get it to work. Even though this makes sense statistically, the underlying message is basically "I have no idea if this is going to work, so I need 3 months to waste your money, learn how to do this for you and then hopefully at that point we will be able to get some results". As someone who runs these sorts of campaigns for people, knowing that this is the simply reality stresses me to the point of hair pulling. Because money is exhaustive, every dollar spent on marketing is not spent paying employee's, rent, groceries, or even yourself (but seriously... who gets paid when they own a business?). Even if your business happens to be cash flush, and has marketing budgets set-aside, someone's job is on the line, based on the success of the dollars they invest.

Yes, as an agency or consultancy, we take on risk. We have the risk of future business, which is really us solving our own "How do I get new customers" issues, but we aren't playing with our money. We aren't taking the risk.

So, do you work with Agencies that take on the risk? Work on a commission basis? Well, I can speak from experience that these agencies won't last long. Because they don't control the product, it becomes too difficult for them to assume the risk because they don't own the product and have to work off of the previous companies assumptions and limitations.

**SO WHAT DO YOU DO?**

I've searched and searched for this answer, and every time that I do, I end up back to this:

## Have a flipping awesome product (or service) that is worth every penny people pay for it!

Want an example of what I mean? Of course, you do:

I spend $45 to get my hair cut. I understand that if you are a lady you are probably thinking "WHAT!! THAT'S IT??", but for a guy's cut, this is pretty expensive. But I have never felt that the price was too high and here's why

 1. You enter a beautifully laid out, men's only shop downtown Burlington, ON. Frank Sinatra music playing in the background and you are greeted with friendly smiles of the staff.

 2. Even though the owner has only met you once, he remembers you and calls you by name.

 3. They offer to take your coat for you, which the hang-up properly as to now cause damage

 4. You are offered a delicious espresso and based biscotti (baked by his Italian mother-in-law)

 5. They sweet and kind assistants take you over the sink and wash your hair out. They wash, condition, and given the most wonderful head massage.

 6. You are then given an expert haircut

 7. Your hair is then washed out a second time, to assure that you don't have bits of hair stuck to your neck all day.

 8. Straight razor shaves on the back of the neck

 9. You are then taken to the styling chair, where your hair styled. Following this, a hot towel is placed on your face as their lay the chair down and give you a hand massage and nail file.

10. Did I mention they have their liquor license!

This is an example of an incredible offering. This is a service that stands above its competitors, and can get away with charging for it a lot for its services.

Now this business, like all businesses will face challenges, and they will ask the same question "how do I get new customers", but finding the answer to that question becomes easier. Because the simple reality is, if you are selling something that people want, and it is actually awesome, people will buy it.

## it doesn't matter what industry you are talking about, something awesome will always sell.

That's why we've changed our approach. We used to start with the Brand and Brand assets, but clients often couldn't justify the expense right away because they needed to make sales NOW. So, we adjusted and developed a 360 marketing package that would handle all area's of marketing a company, and we assumed risk to prove our worth. But, as we spend time working with businesses, we have had to pause and change again to go back to square one and Look at the product its self. Because, if the product is no good, then no matter how good the branding is, or how good the marketing is. It won't work. It won't last.

Reverb comes from the word reverberation (or if you are a musician, the guitar effect of reverb) which is defined in one way:

"Physics. the persistence of a sound after its source has stopped"

Our goal it to work with companies to help them sell an amazing product or service. However if they don't have one yet, then we don't want to drop them to gutters. We will work with them, helping them create that amazing product or service. This can be done through helping them develop systems to run their internal operations so that they have more time to work with customers, or from doing product assessment to full product builds and redesigns.

We want you to be successful, however, we can't do that if your business won't sell.
