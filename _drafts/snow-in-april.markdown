# It caught me by surprise...

I didn't expect it.

Which is odd, because it's really not that crazy to have snow. It's still April, it's not *that* far past winter. However it is officially spring, and as soon as spring comes we tend to move forward, quickly, looking forward to the warmth of winter.

At least I do...

But, here we are, with 22cm of snow forecasted for tonight, and it has got me thinking. Thinking about how quickly and unpredictably things change. As soon as we feel that we have our direction figured out, or that we have mastered the system, things change. Often quite drastically. Leaving us all to try and pick-up the pieces and adjust while things seem to move forward without us.

As someone who has issues with not being in control, this drives me insane. It makes me think of that awful phrase \* "expect the unexpected"\*

### IF I COULD DO THAT, IT WOULDN'T BE UNEXPECTED!

Now before you jump down my throat, I know that the phrase is really saying, be prepared for things to come up that you couldn't foresee, however, it doesn't change the fact that statement drives me crazy. It really just means, that no matter what you do to prepare, you won't be prepared enough.

This was slapped in my face last night...

For those who don't know, I am an avid guitar player. I still have lingering dreams of playing guitar professionally... But, bands are hard to keep together and I don't like being a session player (the control issues mentioned above). Last night, myself and some friends we invited to play at a CD opening for a group. Now, to understand this fully, I have a friend who I write songs with occasionally, these have never been played with a full band. So, like a true entrepreneur, I said: "Of course we can do that!". Which left us 1 month to find other musicians, finish the songs, write their parts, and then actually rehearse with them enough so that we can perform without sounding like buffoons. Sounds insane right? Probably was.

But... We did it. We found the musicians, finished the songs, wrote their parts, rehearsed them so that they sounded good and go out selves to the show in good spirits. Everything was going as planned.

Feeling confident, after the first band was fairly mediocre, we set-up on stage. We moved like clock-work, and within minutes we were set-up and ready to go, enough time to tune up and start as the timer counted down. 3..2..1... and the drummer clicks us in, I strum my guitar, and I hear nothing.

nothing...

I look around, and the rest of the band are playing along swimmingly, I hear them coming through the system but my guitar is nowhere to be found. Frantically (but still remaining calm & cool ;) I check all my cables. Everything is intact. I check my amp on the side. Everything is switched on and I can hear sound coming from it. As a final resort, I check the mic, but it's plugged in and cable is running to the board.

I'm screwed... The show goes on, and I play along to all the songs, listening to the amp in the back and hoping to God that I am on time and playing the right parts. But... We never recover. I later found out the XLR for the cable died.

# Snow in April.

We had everything figured out. We worked incredibly hard and got it all taken care of, we had sound-check and everything was fine. But, something happened that we couldn't have expected. We had just tested that cable, and in fact had switched it in for one that was actually dead.

I don't like things to be unexpected. As a consultant, it's the absolute worst. My job is to tell people what going to happen. This way they pay me and refer me to their friends. It's a simple system, and as someone who has a great handle on marketing strategy, and how consumers think, you would think that it should be simple. But invariably, I end up facing snow in April.

So what do you do?

After much reflection on last night, and the weather that is to come, it has left me with this thought.
