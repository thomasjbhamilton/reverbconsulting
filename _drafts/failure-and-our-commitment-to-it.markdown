Failure is a hard thing to talk about. No consultant can really ever admit to it without it hurting their credibility since we are the ones hired to prevent others from failure. Not to mention that in general, the general public is ashamed to talk about failure at all.

I know I am...

But it does strike me as odd that this is the case, as it is (usually) failure that is life greatest teacher. This principal applies both personally and professionally. Because, if we don't fail, we won't/can't know how to succeed or improve.

I could go on and on with examples, but I don't think that anybody reading this needs much convincing. Besides, it's not that we don't understand the valuable learning that comes from failure, it's that we hate the pain associated with it. It's the pain of failure that makes it hard to talk about it.

That pain can take many forms. Embarrassment, sadness, anger, regret, and a whole host of other emotions. But, whichever it is, it's that feeling of pain that makes regret hard to talk about. It's that pain that makes us fear the future.

Now, this is not always the case. There are some people in this world who are lucky, and they are able to handle failure with ease. They can see a situation where they failed and simply think "I will do that differently next time.", before moving on with their life...I don't know how, but they seem to be able to do it.

 However, lots of us (normal people) can't do that. We feel the pain. We experience the hurt that sits in the pit of your stomach and burns away at us, keeping us up at night and robbing our of joy.

**I know I do...**

But we try our best to overcome. We read self-help books, and news articles written by fantastic writers. 

Recently there has been some great articles written on dealing with failure, and how to change your outlook on it, and I think those are good. Those writings are helpful to provide perspective on how to adjust your mindset to better help you with success. However, my struggle with all of that great work is that I don't always see that line of thinking play out in reality.

We are humans, we are unique and all have different personalities. We feel and experience things differently. To say that we just need to adjust our mindsets is almost like telling us to change who we are. Reading the top ten steps on how to change your mind and better deal with fear, makes it about as easy as telling someone ten top tips to losing weight. It goes deeper than that. To try to overcome that fear requires us to dig deep into who we are and work to change that.

Which, if it's going to be that much effort, begs the question: Why?

As true as it is that we need to overcome the stranglehold that fear of failure can have on letting us start something new, or take a risk in life. We need to wary of anytime someone says we need to eliminate our fear of failure completely.

**Because...**

We need that fear of failure. It's that same fear of failure that keeps us alive. It's what allows us to dig deep within ourselves and find what little strength we have left to push through the next day.

Fear of failure gives us grit. The grit needed to fight for every last inch.

Which is what has always bothered me about the rhetoric surrounding failure and the tech culture who have been known to embrace failure. Not that there isn't incredible value in embracing failure as part of the game because there is. However there is also an incredible danger in not understanding the difference between the accepting of failure as an outcome, and losing the fear of it.

If you aren't scared to fail, then you are not fighting to succeed. Which translates to success being a nice bonus if you don't happen to fail first.

If there is no fear of downside, then how can there be a major commitment to the upside? There can't be. It's simple logic: If you are not scared of the consequences, then you don't have a reason to give something everything you've got.

Think about it this way. If you hire an agency or consultancy to work for you, you want them to be scared of failure. You want failure to keep them up at night. You want them to dread it because it means that they are going to do everything in their power to find success for you. You don't want someone to say "We are risk-takers who aren't afraid to fail!".

Because that's why you hire them. To help stop you from failing by lending their expertise. As a way to mitigate risk. To buffer the blame you apply to yourself.

If they couldn't do it, and they are the experts, then obviously I couldn't have done it. It must have been a lost cause that I happened to get sucked into.

But the reality is that even the experts fail: I fail. Often.
